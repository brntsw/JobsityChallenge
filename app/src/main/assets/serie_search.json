In reality, he is a demon, who came to the human world in search of the ultimate mystery, having already solved every mystery in the demon world. With Yako as his proxy, he feasts on the negative energy released by humans when they commit crimes. Thus, he promises to help Yako solve the mystery of her father's death. But to do so, he must avoid drawing too much attention to himself, which is why Yako plays the role of the detective.<br /><br /><b>Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro </b>follows this unlikely duo as they solve case after case to satisfy Neuro's ravenous appetite and Yako's desperate search for the truth of her father's death.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Paranormal activity has always drawn the curiosity of even the most skeptical minds. That mysticism depends on faith that such events are beyond the realm of science. From ghosts to telekinesis, <b>5th Dimension</b> examines these bizarre occurrences through the lens of science. Many of these happenstances can be discredited, but perhaps there are still phenomena that cannot be explained.</p>",
