Kirby orders pizza, but when the pizza delivery guy shows up and asks for a tip, Kirby, Fish and Eli don't have enough money. The delivery guy then proceeds to hack the Bucket's television and threatens to break his parents rules unless they confess and admit to lies they've told in the past. Meanwhile, breaking one of her parents rules about not leaving the house, Dawn (with Belinda in tow) attempts to get revenge on a girl named Rebecca for taking her dress in gym (forcing her to wear a soccer bag for the rest of the day) by bringing a bag of animal poop. When it turns out that Rebecca is actually very nice, and took her dress by mistake, she tries to leave with her \"purse\" (the bag of dung), but a series of events prevent her from doing so.</p>",
